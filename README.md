## Abstract of Article

Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a technique with high spectral efficiency that isexpected to be applied in future wireless networks. However, its high spectral efficiency comes at the expenseof increased error in data detection. This paper presents theoretical error analysis of a downlink power-domain NOMA-based visible light communication (VLC) system with higher order modulation schemesin which the scenario of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) is considered. Exact closed-form expressions for the symbol error rates (SERs) of the users are derived when the modulation is the squarequadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The derived expressions are applicable to any modulation order ofeach user. In addition, a necessary and sufficient power allocation (PA) constraint is provided for NOMA withhigher order modulation to ensure that the decision regions of the symbols in the superimposed constellationdo not intersect or overlap. The simulation results support the theoretical analysis and the accuracy of thederived expressions. The results demonstrate that the user SER in NOMA-based systems can be minimizedwith a suitable PA that depends on the modulation orders of the users.
